## mocks

During unittesting we will need some core services for mocking certain modules for ease of unittesting

The major ones we will need for now are the following.

1. firebase-mocks. Exported classes for firebase modules for use in unittests
2. config-mock   Exported class for the configuration service
3. user-mock Probably the most central here because we need it for everything
